Full reproducibility requires the possibility to recreate the system that was originally used to generate the results.

# Conda is a package, dependency, and environment manager

--

.green[Package]: any type of program (_e.g._ bowtie2, snakemake etc.)

--

.green[Dependency]: other software required by a package

--

.green[Environment]: a distinct collection of packages

--

<br>
.center[Conda keeps track of the dependencies between packages in each environment]

---

# Conda channels

.green[Channels] are remote directories containing packages.

--

<br>
Two common examples are


- .green[bioconda]: a channel specializing in bioinformatics software

- .green[conda-forge]: a community-led channel made up of thousands of contributors

---

# Conda, Anaconda, Miniconda...

--

- .green[Conda]: the package manager itself, written in python

--


- .green[Anaconda]:
  - an installer for conda containing over 7,500 open-source packages
  - a cloud service where conda packages are hosted ([anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org))
  - a distribution of packages for data science ([anaconda.com](https://anaconda.com))

--


- .green[Miniconda]: an installer for conda containing only the most necessary packages to get started

# Defining and sharing environments

--

Define a conda environment in a YAML file:

```yaml
# --- environment.yml --- #
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - bioconda
dependencies:
  - fastqc=0.11
  - sra-tools=2.8
  - snakemake=4.3.0
  - multiqc=1.3
  - bowtie2=2.3
  - samtools=1.6


# --- environment.yml --- #
```

--

Create an environment from the specifications in the YAML file:
<br>`conda env create --name project_a -f environment.yml`

---

# Defining and sharing environments


Define a conda environment in a YAML file:

```yaml
# --- environment.yml --- #
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - bioconda
dependencies:
  - fastqc=0.11
  - sra-tools=2.8
  - snakemake=4.3.0
  - multiqc=1.3
  - bowtie2=2.3
  - samtools=1.6
  - htseq=0.9
  - graphviz=2.38.0
# --- environment.yml --- #
```


Create an environment from the specifications in the YAML file:
<br>`conda env create --name project_a -f environment.yml`


Update an existing environment based on an environment file:
<br>`conda env update -f environment.yml`

--

Export existing environment as new yaml file (also includes dependencies):
<br>`conda env export > environment_full.yml`

--

Export explicit environment (for the same operating system):
<br>`conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt`
