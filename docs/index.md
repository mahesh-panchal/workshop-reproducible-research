<h3> Course description </h3>

One of the key principles of proper scientific procedure is the act of
repeating an experiment or analysis and being able to reach similar
conclusions. Published research based on computational analysis, *e.g.*
bioinformatics or computational biology, have often suffered from incomplete
method descriptions (*e.g.* list of used software versions); unavailable raw
data; and incomplete, undocumented and/or unavailable code. This essentially
prevents any possibility of reproducing the results of such studies. The term
“reproducible research” has been used to describe the idea that a scientific
publication should be distributed along with all the raw data and metadata used
in the study, all the code and/or computational notebooks needed to produce
results from the raw data, and the computational environment or a complete
description thereof.

Reproducible research not only leads to proper scientific conduct, but also
enables other researchers to build upon previous work. Most importantly, the
person who organizes their work with reproducibility in mind will quickly
realize the immediate personal benefits: an organized and structured way of
working. The person that most often has to reproduce your own analysis is your
future self!

<h3> Course content </h3>

In this course you will learn how to make your data analyses reproducible.

In particular, you will learn:

* Good practices for data analysis and management
* How to use the version control system Git to track edits and collaborate on
  coding
* How to use the package and environment manager Conda
* How to use the workflow manager Snakemake
* How to use R Markdown to generate automated reports
* How to use Jupyter notebooks to document your ongoing analysis
* How to use Docker and Singularity to distribute containerized computational
  environments
